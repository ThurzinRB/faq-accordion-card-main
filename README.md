# [Faq accordion card](https://thurzinrb.github.io/faq-accordion-card-main/index.html)

I took this page as a challenge for myself, it was a great opportunity to improve my CSS, HTML and JS abilities. The page consists in making a responsive FAQ page that shows and hide the answers as the user clicks the questions. I've posted the solution on [Frontend Mentor](http://frontendmentor.io/), and I'm open for suggestions.
